Before his transfer in 1912, Bierkemper constructed a larger mission building with a dormitory, because he recognized the need for a more assertive educational presence in the area. Bierkemper urged the Board of Home Missions to consider a second mission because of the physical difficulty of one station serving the entire reservation. The Dutch Reformed Church offered its properties at Ft. Defiance and its training school at San Juan, NM, which the Women's Board of Home Missions acquired in 1906. In 1911, the training school was transferred to the Ganado mission.

Religious instruction is part of the curriculum. In connection with the school is also a Bible school, under trained leaders, for the preparation of Indian youths for missionary service. The school is handicapped by an inadequate water supply, which it is hoped may be remedied by drilling artesian wells. This is the only Protestant mission boarding school in the heart of the Navajo territory.\" In 1911, the Presbyterian Board of Home Missions approved the construction of a 12-bed hospital in Ganado and in 1930, Dr. Clarence Salsbury, a Presbyterian missionary and physician associated with the hospital, founded Sage Memorial Hospital School of Nursing.

After that construction, the school was rebuilt about a 1/2 mile above Hali Church. Shortly after annexation of Hawaii to the United States just prior to 1900, the school leadership sought to take advantage of the new relationship with the U.S. Government and entered into an agreement to place an agricultural station for the US Department of Agriculture on the school premises, where farm operations were ongoing. As a result of the deficiencies noted in the 1920 DOI Survey of Education for Hawaii, the school ceased regular school operations in 1925 and transitioned to more general community use. In the 1940s, the dormitory buildings were all used by the U.S. military during WWII. Ultimately, the school was razed entirely between 1968 to 1972.

The Kansas Historical Society documents that the mission building and grounds were sold to Thomas Huffaker in 1865, and he continued in possession for 14 years. Thereafter, several individuals owned the property until 1926 when Carl I. Huffaker, one of Thomas' sons, bought the land on which the mission building stands.

In the 1870s, the school for boys was chartered as the St. Francis Institute, and the school for girls was chartered as St. Ann's Academy.

By the Indian Appropriation Act approved on March 3, 1891, Congress made an appropriation for the purchase of land or improvements and construction of buildings for this school not to exceed $6000. In the 1930s, Phoenix Indian School discontinued the lower grades, which moved to on-reservation schools, and began to serve only students in grades 9-12. As attitudes about American Indian education changed and with the Johnson-O\u2019Malley Act of 1934, more tribes started building schools and taking control of the educational needs of their students. This shift lead to a decline in enrollment and the Phoenix Indian School closed in 1990."

Per the 1898 IA Report of the Commissioner of the Office of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior, pg. 12, Rainy Mountain Boarding School was listed as a government reservation boarding school."

Overcrowded conditions forced the sisters to transfer them from St. Cloud to St. Joseph and back again until it was decided to move the girls to the sisters' quarters in Pierz, Minnesota, and the boys were moved back to the old log church and school in St. Joseph. When the fire of 1886 destroyed the orphan home in St. Joseph, the sisters made room for the 23 orphan boys in other buildings on the premises. Finally, at the request of Bishop Otto Zardetti in 1893, the orphans were given to the care of the newly-founded community of Sisters of St. Francis in Little Falls. The Sisters at St. Benedict's, however, retained the familial atmosphere experienced with the presence of the orphan children by opening the Bethlehem School for Little Boys as a department of St. Benedict's Academy."

The 1881 IA Report describes the boys and girls as being taught and housed in separate buildings and under separate government contracts - it is believed the separate contracts are why the statistics table counts this as two schools at Flathead Reservation.

Much of the site was subsequently deeded to the State of Nevada.

The main Tullahassee building was largely destroyed by an accidental fire in December 1880. The Muscogee Creek Council relocated their children to a new school, Wealaka Mission, as their population had been declining in Tullahassee.
