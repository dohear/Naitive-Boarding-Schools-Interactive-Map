# Boarding Schools Interactive Map MVP

## Project Overview
This project aims to make historical information about Native American boarding schools more accessible to the public. The focus is on displaying information through an interactive map, using data gathered from Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative Investigative Report. By synthesizing and visualizing this data, the project seeks to reconstruct and bring awareness to one of America's less known histories. The initial goal is to provide a minimum viable product framework that can be built on by future researchers.

### Inspiration
This project is inspired by:
- Research on Land-Grab Universities - https://github.com/HCN-Digital-Projects/landgrabu-data.
- The need for related to Indigenous history.
- Datasets and records, including archives at Marquette University.

## Data Sources
1. **Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative Investigative Report**


### Detailed School Information
- Name(s)
- Locations
- Dates of operation
- Housing
- Education
- School type
- other general notes
       

### Data Download
In the data directory you can find both the original PDF dataset used, as well as its .json version. I also included the python scripts used to scrape the info out of the PDFs. 

## Ethical Considerations for future developers
- **FERPA Compliance:** Protecting student privacy and ensuring adherence to regulations.
- **Respect for Tribal Privacy:** Consulting with Tribal Nations to ensure data use aligns with community values.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the institutional histories of Native American boarding schools and the cultural interactions between Tribal Nations, the U.S. government, and religious orders. By creating a tool that synthesizes and visualizes this information, it serves as a resource for:
- Supporting research and education.
- Promoting public awareness of Indigenous history.

The ultimate goal is to make this important historical information accessible, readable, and actionable for wider audiences.
